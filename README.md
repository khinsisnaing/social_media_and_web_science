### Project Title:
**Impact of Age on Addiction Levels and User Satisfaction on TikTok**

### Introduction:
This academic research project explores the relationship between age, addiction levels, and user satisfaction on TikTok. With TikTok's rise as a dominant social media platform, understanding the varying effects it has on different age groups is crucial. This study examines how addiction levels differ across age groups and how these levels correlate with user satisfaction.

### Research Objective:
The primary aim of this research is to analyze how age influences addiction levels and user satisfaction on TikTok. By categorizing users into distinct age groups, the research investigates which groups are most susceptible to addictive behaviors and how satisfaction with the platform's content varies by age.

### Dataset:
The dataset used for this research was obtained from Kaggle. The "Time-Wasters on Social Media" dataset provides a synthetic representation of user behavior across various social media platforms, including TikTok. The dataset captures key attributes such as age, addiction level, satisfaction, and engagement metrics.

###The research involved:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Age Grouping: Users were categorized into five age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64) to allow for targeted analysis.
3. Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationship between addiction levels and satisfaction across different age groups.
